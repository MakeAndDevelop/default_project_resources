## Branching strategy
With explicity versioned software, like mobile apps and desktop apps, we use the git flow:
* [Git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

## Coding Guidelines
We code in compliance to the Google guidelines, conventions and standards for Dart development:
* [Effective Dart style](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)

We enforce these guidelines by linting with the current configuration:
* [Official flutter linting config](https://github.com/flutter/packages/blob/master/packages/flutter_lints/lib/flutter.yaml)
